# daily_coding_problems
The repository is aimed at solving various data structures and algorithms problems.

![coding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83579289/160063995-4ec46a76-5e3f-4a67-ba3b-ff914735b5c9.jpeg)

The sources used for the algorithm problems are:
  LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/)
  DailyCodingProblems (https://dailycodingproblem.com - problems received on subscription on daily basis over email)

The problems are the solutions of mine, since few algorithm solutions are paid in both the above mentioned domains, this is a mere platform to discuss
and enjoy coding for free and enhance by improving each other's solutions.

Let's make a better world by helping each other developing knowledge.

Note: Each program can be executed independently.
