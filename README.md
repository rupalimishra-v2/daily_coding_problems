# daily_coding_problems
The repository is aimed at solving various data structures and algorithms problems.

![coding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83579289/160063995-4ec46a76-5e3f-4a67-ba3b-ff914735b5c9.jpeg)

The sources used for the algorithm problems are:
  DailyCodingProblems (https://dailycodingproblem.com - problems received on subscription on daily basis over email)
  Basic algorithm practice problems such as How to create linked list, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms etc.
  
The project is divided into two modules: 
  Algorithms (https://github.com/rupalimishra-v2/daily_coding_problems/tree/main/Algorithms)
  DailyCodingProblems (https://github.com/rupalimishra-v2/daily_coding_problems/tree/main/DailyCodingProblems)
 
 Note : Each module is independent and can be executed independently, irrespective of interfering with other modules. Each program can be executed independently (with the help of main function, obviously :P)

The problems are the solutions of mine, since few algorithm solutions are paid in the above mentioned domains, this is a mere platform to discuss
and enjoy coding for free and enhance by improving each other's solutions.

Let's make a better world by helping each other developing knowledge.
